## Usage
To use this boilerplate, follow the steps below:

- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Open the index.html file in your preferred code editor.
- Modify the content within the <body> tags to suit your project requirements.
- Add additional HTML files if needed, and link them together using anchor tags `<a>`

## Features
### Doctype Declaration
The boilerplate includes the HTML 5 doctype declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the beginning of each HTML page. This tells the browser which version of HTML is being used and ensures proper rendering of the content.

### Metadata
The `<head>` section of the HTML file contains metadata elements that provide information about the document. The following metadata tags are included:
- `<title>` Defines the title of the document displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` Specifies the character encoding for the document (UTF-8 
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` Sets the viewport properties for responsive web design.

## External Stylesheets
The boilerplate allows you to link external stylesheets to your HTML pages. Simply add the stylesheet links within the `<head>` section using the `<link>` tag. This enables you to separate the styling from the HTML content, making it easier to manage and update your styles.

## Script Tags
You can include JavaScript files in your HTML pages using script tags. The boilerplate includes a script tag at the bottom of the `<body>` section for adding your custom JavaScript code or linking external JavaScript files.
